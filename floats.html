<p class="MainText"> GILGAMESH went abroad in the world, but he met with none who could withstand his arms till be came to
  Uruk. But the men of Uruk muttered in their houses, â€˜Gilgamesh sounds the tocsin for his amusement, his arrogance
  has no bounds by day or night. No son is left with his father, for Gilgamesh takes them all, even the children; yet the
  king should be a shepherd to his people. His lust leaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the
  wife of the noble; yet this is the shepherd of the city, wise, comely, and resolute.' </p>
