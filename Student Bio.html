      <p>Mesopotamia encompasses the land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, both of which have 
        their headwaters in the Taurus Mountains. Both rivers are fed by numerous tributaries, and 
        the entire river system drains a vast mountainous region. Overland routes in Mesopotamia 
        usually follow the Euphrates because the banks of the Tigris are frequently steep and difficult.
         The climate of the region is semi-arid with a vast desert expanse in the north which gives way
          to a 15,000-square-kilometre (5,800 sq mi) region of marshes, lagoons, mud flats, and reed 
          banks in the south. In the extreme south, the Euphrates and the Tigris unite and empty into 
          the Persian Gulf. </p>
